# Review Process Rules

These are non-negotiable rules for conducting reviews in ACM projects.

## Mandatory Process

- All stage reviews MUST use the `acm-review` plugin (`/acm-review:artifact`, `/acm-review:artifact-internal`, `/acm-review:artifact-external`)
- Do NOT substitute ad-hoc agents, manual review loops, or custom prompts for the review mechanism
- Internal review (Phase 1) is MANDATORY for every reviewable artifact at every stage
- External review (Phase 2) is USER-DRIVEN — only conduct when the user requests it

## What Agents Must NOT Do

- Do NOT skip internal review or claim it's unnecessary
- Do NOT improvise review mechanisms that approximate the Ralph Loop
- Do NOT decide whether external review is needed — that is the user's decision
- Do NOT expand scope during reviews — find problems, not opportunities
