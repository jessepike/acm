# Project Health Auditor

Code-level health auditing for any project. Complements adf-env (governance/environment layer) and adf-review (artifact quality). Runs standard language tools and pattern matching — no scripts, no MCP dependencies.

## Relationship to Other Tools

| Tool | Layer | Focus |
|------|-------|-------|
| adf-env:audit | Environment / governance | Artifacts, CLAUDE.md, plugins, hooks, MCP, session discipline |
| adf-review | Artifact quality | Design docs, specs, briefs — structural and semantic review |
| **project-health** | **Code / implementation** | **Tests, deps, code hygiene, secrets, design drift, docs sync** |

No overlap. They are complementary.

## Pre-flight

Before running checks, detect the project environment:

### 1. Language Detection

Scan project root for markers:

| Marker File | Language |
|-------------|----------|
| `package.json` | TypeScript / JavaScript |
| `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.py` | Python |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust |
| `go.mod` | Go |

Multiple markers = polyglot project. Run checks for all detected languages.

### 2. Stage Detection

Read `status.md` frontmatter for `stage:` value. Determines which check categories run (see Stage Awareness below).

### 3. Tool Availability

Before running a check that requires a CLI tool, verify it exists:
```
which pytest  # or npm, cargo, go, etc.
```
If missing, skip that specific check and note it in the report as SKIPPED.

## Check Categories

Six categories, 19 total checks. Details and exact commands in `references/check-catalog.md`.

### 1. Test Health

| Check | What | Severity Threshold |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| Coverage gaps | Lines/branches not covered by tests | <60% FAIL, <80% WARN |
| Skipped tests | Tests marked skip/TODO with age | >60d HIGH, >30d MEDIUM |
| Collection errors | Tests that fail to collect/import | Any = HIGH |
| Test staleness | Test files not modified in 30+ days while src changed | Informational MEDIUM |

### 2. Dependency Health

| Check | What | Severity Threshold |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| Outdated packages | Packages behind latest | Major version = HIGH |
| Security vulnerabilities | Known CVEs in deps | Critical/High CVE = CRITICAL |
| Unused deps | Declared but not imported | Any = LOW |
| Missing lockfile | No lockfile present | Missing = HIGH |

### 3. Code Hygiene

| Check | What | Severity Threshold |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| Stale TODOs/FIXMEs | TODO/FIXME comments aged via git blame | >60d HIGH, >30d MEDIUM |
| Commented-out code | Blocks of commented code (>5 lines) | Any = LOW |
| Print debugging | console.log/print()/fmt.Println in non-test files | Any = MEDIUM |
| Placeholder implementations | NotImplementedError/unimplemented!/TODO throws | Any = HIGH |

### 4. Secrets & Config

| Check | What | Severity Threshold |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| Hardcoded secrets | API keys, passwords, tokens with literal values | Any = CRITICAL |
| .env safety | .env exists but not gitignored | Not ignored = CRITICAL |
| Missing .env.example | .env exists without .env.example | Missing = LOW |

### 5. Build-to-Design Drift (ADF projects only)

| Check | What | Severity Threshold |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| Component alignment | Components in design.md not in code (and vice versa) | Missing impl = HIGH |
| API contract drift | Endpoints in design.md vs route definitions | Mismatch = HIGH |

Skip this entire category if `docs/design.md` does not exist.

### 6. Documentation Sync

| Check | What | Severity Threshold |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| Dead internal links | Markdown links pointing to nonexistent files | Any = MEDIUM |
| Version references | Doc version strings vs package version | Mismatch = LOW |

## Stage Awareness

Check categories vary by project stage:

| Stage | Categories Run |
|-------|---------------|
| **Develop** | All 6 categories |
| **Deliver** | Secrets, Deps, Docs (deployment readiness focus) |
| **Design / Discover** | Secrets, Deps baseline only |

If no stage is detected (non-ADF project), run all 6 categories.

## Execution Order

1. **Pre-flight** — language detection, stage detection, tool availability
2. **Run checks** — iterate categories per stage awareness, skip unavailable tools
3. **Classify findings** — assign severity (Critical > High > Medium > Low)
4. **Generate report** — structured output per category
5. **File backlog** (if `--file-backlog`) — append Critical/High to BACKLOG.md

## Report Format

Output a structured report with this format:

```
## Project Health Report

**Project:** <name from package.json/pyproject.toml/Cargo.toml>
**Language(s):** <detected>
**Stage:** <from status.md or "N/A">
**Date:** <today>
**Scope:** <all or specific category>

### Summary

| Category | Status | Critical | High | Medium | Low |
|----------|--------|----------|------|--------|-----|
| Test Health | WARN | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 |
| Dependency Health | FAIL | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Code Hygiene | PASS | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| Secrets & Config | PASS | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Design Drift | SKIP | - | - | - | - |
| Documentation Sync | PASS | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

**Overall: WARN** (1 Critical, 1 High, 2 Medium, 1 Low)

### Findings

#### [CRITICAL] Security vulnerability in dependency
- **Category:** Dependency Health
- **Detail:** lodash@4.17.15 has known prototype pollution (CVE-2021-23337)
- **Remediation:** Run `npm audit fix` or update to lodash@4.17.21+

#### [HIGH] Coverage below threshold
- **Category:** Test Health
- **Detail:** Overall coverage 58% (threshold: 60%)
- **Files:** src/auth/handler.ts (12%), src/api/routes.ts (34%)
- **Remediation:** Add tests for uncovered files, prioritize critical paths
```

**Status rules:**
- FAIL = any Critical finding
- WARN = any High finding (no Critical)
- PASS = Medium/Low only or no findings
- SKIP = category not run (stage filter or missing tools)

## Backlog Filing

When `--file-backlog` is set:

1. Read `BACKLOG.md`, find the highest B-number
2. For each Critical or High finding, append an entry:

```markdown
### B<next> — <finding title>
- **Type:** Bug | Tech Debt | Security
- **Size:** S | M | L (estimate based on remediation complexity)
- **Source:** Project Health Audit <date>
- **Detail:** <finding detail>
- **Remediation:** <suggested fix>
```

3. Map finding categories to types:
   - Secrets → Security
   - Vulnerabilities → Security
   - Coverage/test issues → Tech Debt
   - Stale TODOs → Tech Debt
   - Design drift → Bug
   - Placeholder implementations → Bug

## Integration Points

- **adf-env** — Governance complement. Run `adf-env:audit` for environment health + `project-health` for code health = complete picture.
- **design.md** — Source for design-drift checks. Component list and API contracts extracted from design.md sections.
- **BACKLOG.md** — Target for `--file-backlog` auto-filing.
- **status.md** — Source for stage detection (determines which categories run).
- **adf-review** — Pre-review health gate. Run `project-health` before `adf-review` to ensure code-level issues are captured before artifact review.

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Tool not installed (pytest, npm, etc.) | Skip that check, mark SKIPPED in report, list in "Skipped Checks" section |
| No code detected (no language markers) | Exit gracefully: "No supported language detected. Nothing to audit." |
| Non-ADF project (no design.md) | Skip design-drift category, run everything else |
| Permission error on a file | Skip that file, continue, note in report |
| Empty test suite | Report as informational, not a failure |
| No BACKLOG.md for filing | Warn and output findings to console only |

## Quick Reference

**Trigger phrases:**
- "check code health", "audit codebase", "run health check"
- "check test coverage", "dependency audit", "find stale TODOs"
- "check for secrets", "design drift check", "code hygiene"
- "pre-review health check"

**Scope shortcuts:**
- `/project-health` — all categories
- `/project-health --scope tests` — test health only
- `/project-health --scope deps` — dependency health only
- `/project-health --scope hygiene` — code hygiene only
- `/project-health --scope secrets` — secrets & config only
- `/project-health --scope design-drift` — design drift only
- `/project-health --scope docs` — documentation sync only

**Severity scale:** Critical > High > Medium > Low

**Language auto-detection:** Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Go, Rust (polyglot supported)

**Backlog filing:** `--file-backlog` appends Critical/High findings to BACKLOG.md
